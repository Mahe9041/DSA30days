#RECURSION 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
When a funtion calls itself untill a specified condition is met.
->base case: the end condition when the recurtion breaks and starts to return.
->stackflow: when there is no end condition in a recursion the programme runs till memory stack is completely filled this is called stackover flow.
->recursion tree-> way of representing recurion calls.

#Backtraking 
Same as recursion but the print statement is after recusion call.

Recursion is of 2 types :
1.Parametic form:
normal recusion statement.
2.Funtional form:
recursion call is inside return statement.
